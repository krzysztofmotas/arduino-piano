## About the Project

**Arduino Piano** is a functional musical instrument based on Arduino that enables playing simple melodies as well as recording and playback. The project combines elements of digital electronics, microcontroller programming, and audio signal processing.

### Main Features:
- 5 buttons representing notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G)
- Recording mode with visualization (red LED)
- Playback mode for saved melodies (green LED)
- 7-segment display showing the currently played note
- Sound generation through piezo buzzer
- Ability to save up to 100 notes

### Circuit Layout

## Features

### 1. Normal Play Mode
- Press note buttons to play melodies in real-time
- Each note is displayed on the LED display
- Generation of sounds at appropriate frequencies (261-392 Hz)

### 2. Melody Recording
- Press the **RECORD** button to start recording
- The red LED lights up
- Play the melody - all notes are saved with duration
- Press **RECORD** again to finish

### 3. Melody Playback
- Press the **PLAY** button to play the saved melody
- The green LED lights up
- The device automatically plays all saved notes
- Visualization of each note on the display

### 4. Serial Port Debugging
- Real-time application state monitoring
- Button press logging
- Information about the number of saved notes

## Installation

### Requirements
- Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x or newer)
- `Wire.h` library (built into Arduino IDE)
- USB cable for programming Arduino

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arduino-piano.git
   cd arduino-piano
   ```

2. **Open the project in Arduino IDE:**
   ```
   File → Open → source.ino
   ```

3. **Select the board:**
   ```
   Tools → Board → Arduino Uno (or Nano)
   ```

4. **Select the COM port:**
   ```
   Tools → Port → [select USB port]
   ```

5. **Upload the code:**
   ```
   Sketch → Upload (Ctrl+U)
   ```

6. **Open Serial Monitor:**
   ```
   Tools → Serial Monitor (9600 baud)
   ```

## Usage Instructions

### First Launch
1. Connect Arduino to the computer via USB
2. Wait for the message `"Piano ready!"` in the Serial Monitor
3. The device is ready to use

### Playing Melodies
```
1. Press note buttons (C, D, E, F, G)
2. Watch the LED display - it shows the current note
3. Listen to sounds from the piezo buzzer
```

### Recording
```
1. Press RECORD (red LED lights up)
2. Play the melody
3. Press RECORD again (LED turns off)
4. Serial Monitor shows: "*** RECORDING FINISHED - saved X notes ***"
```

### Playback
```
1. Press PLAY (green LED lights up)
2. The device plays the saved melody
3. After completion, the LED turns off
```

> **Note:** If there is no saved melody, you will hear a double error signal (200 Hz).
